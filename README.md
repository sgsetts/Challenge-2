## Description


As a student persuing a career in web development, it is important that I have a portfolio that puts my best foot forward for potential employers. As it is early in my studies, it is a work in progress and showcases what I have complpeted thus far and is structured to be built upon as I complete more projects. See below for a screenshot of the deployed website.
